# Security-testable Flask API

This improves over the [previous version](https://github.com/AlfredoPardo/security-testable-flask-api-pv/tree/02-Refactoring-Restplus) adding a MongoDB database, containerizing the API, and starting up everything from docker-compose.

A Postman collection is also included

## Start the Database and API

> $ docker-compose build && docker-compose up

## Pending
- Organize configurations independently


This API is available at: http://127.0.0.1:5000/
